**Last updated:** December 28, 2025

YouTube Shorts Blocker is a browser extension that helps users stay focused by hiding YouTube Shorts content. Your privacy is important to us, and this extension was designed with that in mind.

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser. It:
